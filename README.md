# Hi there, I'm MD LUTFUL KABIR! üëã

**Data Scientist | Deep Learning & NLP | GenAI | MLOps **

With knowledge in Deep Learning, NLP, and AI, I work across the entire AI pipeline‚Äîfrom data collection to model deployment. My experience includes developing and fine-tuning neural networks like  RNNs, and transformers (e.g., BERT, GPT) for applications in NLP, and predictive analytics. I specialize in transforming data into actionable insights and building robust, end-to-end AI solutions for impactful, real-world use.

## üìä Projects

### Highlighted Projects

- **Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification** [Link](https://github.com/lut-ful/Unintended-Bias-in-Toxicity-Classification)
   - This project aims to solve the Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification problem from a Kaggle competition hosted by Jigsaw and Google's Conversation AI team. The objective is to build machine learning models that can detect toxicity in online conversations while minimizing unintended bias, particularly with regard to identity terms.

- **ML project to demonstrate CI/CD model** [Link](https://github.com/lut-ful/mlproject)
   - Simple ML project in using CI/CD model. Fully project implementation is more focused than ML model development.
   
- **IBM Capstone Project: Stack Overflow Job Survey** [Link](https://github.com/lut-ful/IBM-Capstone-Project-Stack-Overflow-Job-Survey)
   - Analyzed developer trends and predicted future trends using Python, SQL, Cognos and looker. Results in PowerPoint and Jupyter Notebook
